# Security Audit and Fixes Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified and fixed in the user registration and login system. The fixes address various security concerns including SQL injection, password storage, file upload security, path traversal, and session management.

## Files Modified and Changes Made

### 1. registerUser.php
**Changes Made:**
- Fixed SQL injection vulnerability by properly using prepared statements
- Implemented secure password hashing using `password_hash()` with BCRYPT
- Added comprehensive file upload security measures
- Fixed path traversal vulnerability in file uploads
- Added CSRF protection
- Improved error handling and messages
- Fixed incorrect redirect paths

**Security Improvements:**
- Password hashing prevents plain text storage
- File upload validation prevents malicious file execution
- Path traversal prevention ensures files are stored in allowed directories
- CSRF protection prevents cross-site request forgery attacks
- Secure error messages prevent information disclosure

### 2. loginUser.php
**Changes Made:**
- Added secure session parameters
- Implemented proper password verification using `password_verify()`
- Added session regeneration to prevent session fixation
- Improved error messages to prevent username enumeration
- Fixed incorrect redirect paths
- Added CSRF token generation

**Security Improvements:**
- Secure session configuration prevents session hijacking
- Password verification ensures secure authentication
- Generic error messages prevent user enumeration
- Session regeneration prevents session fixation attacks

### 3. login.php
**Changes Made:**
- Added session start at the beginning
- Fixed HTML escaping in error messages
- Added success message handling
- Fixed input field attributes
- Improved form security

**Security Improvements:**
- Proper session initialization
- XSS prevention through proper output encoding
- Secure form handling

### 4. config.php
**Changes Made:**
- Added environment variable support for database credentials
- Improved error handling
- Added character set configuration
- Added secure error logging

**Security Improvements:**
- Removed hardcoded credentials
- Secure error handling prevents information disclosure
- Proper character encoding prevents injection attacks

### 5. Database Changes
**Changes Made:**
- Modified Password column to VARCHAR(255) to accommodate bcrypt hashes
- Added NOT NULL constraint to Password field

**Security Improvements:**
- Proper storage for secure password hashes
- Data integrity through constraints

## Path Fixes
1. Changed all redirect paths to use relative paths:
   - From: `../coursework/login.php` → To: `login.php`
   - From: `../coursework/register.php` → To: `register.php`
   - From: `../coursework/index.php` → To: `index.php`

2. Fixed file upload paths:
   - From: `../coursework/profilepicuploads/` → To: `profilepicuploads/`
   - Added proper path validation and sanitization

## Error Fixes
1. Fixed SQL errors:
   - Removed duplicate `execute()` calls
   - Fixed prepared statement parameter binding
   - Added proper error handling for database operations

2. Fixed path errors:
   - Corrected all redirect paths
   - Fixed file upload directory paths
   - Added path validation

3. Fixed session errors:
   - Added proper session initialization
   - Fixed session regeneration
   - Added secure session parameters

## Security Improvements Summary
1. Authentication:
   - Secure password hashing
   - Proper password verification
   - Protection against brute force attacks

2. Session Management:
   - Secure session configuration
   - Session fixation prevention
   - CSRF protection

3. File Upload Security:
   - File type validation
   - Size limits
   - MIME type checking
   - Path traversal prevention

4. Input Validation:
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS prevention
   - Path traversal prevention

5. Error Handling:
   - Secure error messages
   - Proper logging
   - User-friendly error display

## Testing Instructions
1. Database Setup:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users MODIFY COLUMN Password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL;
   ```

2. File Permissions:
   - Ensure `profilepicuploads` directory has proper write permissions
   - Verify file upload limits in PHP configuration

3. Environment Variables:
   - Set up database credentials in environment variables
   - Configure secure session parameters

## Future Recommendations
1. Implement rate limiting for login attempts
2. Add two-factor authentication
3. Implement password complexity requirements
4. Add account lockout after failed attempts
5. Implement secure password reset functionality
6. Add logging for security events
7. Regular security audits and updates
